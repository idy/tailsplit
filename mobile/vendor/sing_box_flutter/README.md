# sing_box_flutter

An independent Flutter plugin for running [sing-box](https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box)
as a native VPN on Android and iOS. Select the compiled protocols in your host
`pubspec.yaml` and build them from source with the pinned **Tailscale Go** compiler.

![Overview: a minimal WGC core is 62–64% smaller than the standard libbox build, the iOS app process has no Go runtime, and three steps build it from the host pubspec.yaml](doc/images/overview.svg)

Sizes compare uncompressed binaries for the minimal WGC profile; see
[measured builds](doc/core-features.md#measured-minimal-wgc-build).

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by SagerNet or Tailscale.

## Platform support

Requires **Flutter 3.47.2+**. The Android integration uses AGP 9.1 with built-in
Kotlin and JDK 17; the checked-in example and CI use the same Flutter toolchain.

| Platform | Native integration | Minimum version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android | Foreground `VpnService`, socket protection, network monitoring | Android 7 / API 24 |
| iOS | `NEPacketTunnelProvider` in a separately signed host extension | iOS 15 |

Flutter controls the service through method channels and receives typed connection
events. Packet processing stays in the native service. Closing the UI or cancelling
a stream subscription does not disconnect the VPN.

The first release provides core version lookup, configuration validation, explicit
VPN consent, start/stop, and connection status. It accepts complete sing-box JSON;
it does not provide a profile editor, subscription manager, or Tailscale account UI.

## Install and build from source

Version 0.3.0 ships source and build scripts. Its GitHub Release has no universal
precompiled libbox `.a`, AAR or XCFramework SDK assets. Compile the capabilities
your app needs from the pinned sources.

Add the dependency and a top-level feature selection to your **Flutter app's**
`pubspec.yaml`, alongside its existing `flutter` configuration:

```yaml
dependencies:
  sing_box_flutter: ^0.3.0

sing_box_flutter:
  core:
    inbounds: [tun]
    outbounds: [direct]
    endpoints: [wgc]
    dns: [udp, tcp, fakeip]
```

Install these build prerequisites:

- Python 3.11+ and Git. Python is also used when Gradle or CocoaPods validates a
  selected core; no third-party Python packages are needed.
- For Android: OpenJDK 17, the Android SDK and NDK `28.0.13004108`.
- For iOS: macOS with Xcode and its iPhoneOS/simulator SDKs, plus CocoaPods for the
  Flutter host integration.

The builder automatically downloads and verifies the pinned **Tailscale Go**
compiler and mobile tools. You do not need to install Go globally. The installed
app needs no separate Go installation; its native core contains the Go runtime.
See [native build details](doc/native-build.md) for SDK configuration and caches.

Run these commands from your Flutter app, selecting the platform you need:

```bash
flutter pub get
dart run sing_box_flutter build --target android
```

```bash
dart run sing_box_flutter build --target apple
```

The builder generates a constructor registry and compiles a small mobile binding
layer directly against the pinned sing-box engine. It does not link the official
libbox RPC/profile-management layer. Required dependencies, such as WGC's userspace
network stack or Hysteria2's QUIC implementation, are resolved automatically.

Artifacts stay in your app's `.dart_tool/sing_box_flutter/`, keyed by feature and
source fingerprints. Gradle and CocoaPods resolve that app's artifact; changing
another app's selection does not overwrite binaries in a shared pub cache.
Rebuild the core after editing the host pubspec, then rebuild the app (on iOS,
rerun `pod install` or let Flutter run it). Neither `flutter pub get` nor a normal
app build silently downloads Go or compiles a new core.

Add `tailscale` or `wireguard` to `endpoints`, or protocols such as `vless`,
`shadowsocks`, and `hysteria2` to `outbounds`. Missing capabilities and unsupported
platform selections fail explicitly. A selected core requires a source build;
`install` cannot satisfy a host feature selection.

The example includes [WGC minimal, WGC + Tailscale and full mobile
profiles](example/core-profiles/README.md), with a tool that switches only its
pubspec feature block. See [feature selection](doc/core-features.md) for defaults,
dependencies, validation semantics, architecture options and the complete
capability catalogue.

### Legacy standard-core compatibility

Hosts without a `sing_box_flutter.core` block retain the standard build/install
path. The installer remains available for historical binary releases such as
`v0.2.0`; 0.3.0 does not publish replacement SDK assets:

```bash
dart run sing_box_flutter install --target android --release v0.2.0
```

```bash
dart run sing_box_flutter install --target apple --release v0.2.0
```

This legacy installer requires Python 3.11+, verifies release checksums and pinned
build metadata, and places artifacts in the resolved plugin directory. Reinstall
them after changing the package version or clearing your pub cache. The standard
source-build helper is also retained; see [legacy build and install details](doc/native-build.md#legacy-standard-core-build-and-install).

### Android host setup

The plugin declares its VPN service and required permissions. Set the host's
`minSdk` to at least 24. VPN consent requires an attached Flutter Activity.
Android runs the service in the foreground with a persistent notification.

### iOS host setup

A Flutter plugin cannot create or sign the host application's Network Extension.
Add a Packet Tunnel extension target, embed it in the app, and configure matching
App Group entitlements on the app and extension. The extension depends on the
plugin's `PacketTunnel` CocoaPods subspec and does not embed Flutter.

Follow [the complete iOS setup guide](doc/ios-setup.md) before running the app.
A physical device is required to test VPN traffic; the simulator can validate
compilation and the UI only.

## Dart API

```dart
import 'package:sing_box_flutter/sing_box_flutter.dart';

final vpn = SingBoxFlutter();

await vpn.initialize(
  // Required on iOS; omit on Android.
  appGroup: 'group.com.example.app',
  providerBundleIdentifier: 'com.example.app.PacketTunnel',
  notificationTitle: 'Example VPN',
);

final subscription = vpn.status.listen((status) {
  print(status.state); // disconnected/connecting/connected/disconnecting/error
});

await vpn.checkConfig(configJson);
if (await vpn.requestPermission()) {
  await vpn.start(config: configJson, name: 'Example VPN');
}

// start() acknowledges the request. Observe the stream for connection success.
final current = await vpn.getStatus();
final version = await vpn.getVersion();

// Disconnect explicitly; disposing the Flutter UI does not own the native VPN.
await vpn.stop();
await subscription.cancel();
```

Invalid JSON is rejected locally. Android checks use the native engine; iOS
`checkConfig` performs structural/capability preflight in the Go-free app, with
full engine validation deferred to extension startup. A successful iOS preflight
does not guarantee startup. Validation and connection failures surface as
`PlatformException`; the plugin avoids including configurations or
authentication keys in its own errors. Treat your configuration JSON as sensitive
and do not write it to application logs.

Multiple plugin objects refer to the same native VPN service. Only one connection
is managed by this plugin at a time. A new event-channel subscription receives the
current native status. Use `getStatus()` to refresh a UI after it resumes.

## WGC support

The matching native build includes a `wgc` endpoint backed directly by
[`idy/wgc`](https://github.com/idy/wgc). Pass ordinary sing-box JSON through the
existing `checkConfig` / `start` methods; the Flutter API and Android/iOS VPN
host remain unchanged. See [WGC endpoint configuration](doc/wgc.md) for keys,
routing, and compiled application transport hooks. This does not copy the WGC
protocol implementation into this repository.

## Tailscale support

Add `tailscale` to `core.endpoints` (and to `core.dns` if using its DNS transport),
then rebuild the selected core. The builder retains the upstream mobile
memory-saving options. Include the endpoint in normal sing-box JSON:

```json
{
  "endpoints": [{
    "type": "tailscale",
    "tag": "tailnet",
    "hostname": "my-flutter-app",
    "system_interface": false,
    "accept_routes": false,
    "exit_node": "100.64.0.10"
  }]
}
```

This is an endpoint fragment, not a complete VPN configuration. Add a TUN inbound,
DNS rules, and routes selecting `tailnet` for the desired traffic. The native core
owns the Tailscale connection inside the same VPN service. Platform VPN limits
mean the design should not depend on another Tailscale VPN app running alongside it.

For unattended authentication, provide an appropriately scoped Tailscale auth key
through your application's secure configuration flow. The plugin does not yet
expose an interactive Tailscale login or endpoint-management API. Do not depend on
log messages as an authentication protocol. See the upstream
[Tailscale endpoint documentation](https://sing-box.sagernet.org/configuration/endpoint/tailscale/).

## Reproducible native builds

All Go compilation uses the Tailscale-maintained Go fork. The build refuses to
substitute a system Go toolchain. Inputs are fixed in [native-core.json](native-core.json):

- sing-box: `1.14.4`, revision `c005f35300ce76427dc285481ec5695f5b179cd2`.
- Tailscale Go: revision `63ae404c8203317fd3c82d972e5dc8f0fcb425cb`.
- SagerNet gomobile: `v0.1.12`.

Use the host-selected `dart run sing_box_flutter build` commands above, whether
the dependency comes from pub.dev or a local source checkout. The builder
bootstraps the pinned compiler automatically; it never substitutes a system Go
installation. Toolchains and source caches live under `.build/` inside the package
checkout, while selected artifacts stay in the host app's `.dart_tool/`.

The pub package must retain `native/mobile/`, `native/wgc/`, `tool/`, pin files and
license notices so hosts can build from source. Build caches and native outputs
are excluded from Git and pub.dev. Temporary CI binary archives are validation
inputs, not 0.3.0 GitHub Release SDK assets. See [native build details](doc/native-build.md)
for SDK prerequisites, verification, artifact provenance and the source-only
publication policy.

## Example and development

The [example](example/) accepts editable sing-box JSON and demonstrates permission,
validation, connection status, and explicit disconnection. Its default configuration
captures traffic through a TUN and routes it directly; it does not connect to an
external proxy or Tailscale network automatically.

```bash
flutter pub get
```

```bash
flutter analyze
```

```bash
flutter test
```

Run the example's widget test from `example/`:

```bash
flutter test
```

```bash
flutter pub publish --dry-run
```

Native compilation and physical-device VPN tests are separate from Dart unit tests.
Before shipping an app, test DNS, IPv4/IPv6, lock/unlock, Wi-Fi/cellular transitions,
permission revocation, and UI restarts on the actual supported OS versions.

## Automated pull-request review

[OpenAI PR review](.github/workflows/openai-code-review.yml) uses the maintained
[GizClaw reviewer](https://github.com/GizClaw/github-workflows) through its `latest`
tag. Configure an `OPENAI_API_KEY` Actions secret in this repository before use.
The caller must be merged into the default branch before its trusted review
worker can run.

Ready PRs are reviewed automatically when opened, reopened, edited, or updated.
Post `@codex review` on its own line in a new PR comment to request a fresh review,
or run the workflow manually with a PR number. Editing a linked Issue also
refreshes its open PRs. Retry with a new request instead of rerunning an old run.

The reviewer publishes `OpenAI PR Review`, `OpenAI Issue Review`, and
`OpenAI Code Review` checks on the reviewed commit. It focuses on Android/iOS VPN
lifecycle, Flutter channel compatibility, sensitive configuration, and native
artifact integrity. These checks complement the existing tests; physical-device
VPN validation remains a separate requirement.
